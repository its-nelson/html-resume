# My Resume Website

Welcome to my personal resume website! This project was created using HTML only to test and solidify my understanding of fundamental HTML concepts. The site showcases my resume, including my education, work experience, skills, and honors and awards.

## Overview
This project serves as a hands-on exercise in HTML. I focused on implementing essential HTML concepts such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and more. The goal was to create a clean, responsive, and well-structured resume website that highlights my professional background.

## Key HTML Concepts Practiced
Here are some of the key HTML concepts I applied in this project:

### 1. **HTML Boilerplate**
   - Used the standard HTML boilerplate to define the basic structure of the document, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

### 2. **Heading Elements**
   - Organized the content using appropriate heading levels (`<h1>` to `<h5>`) to create a clear hierarchy of information.

### 3. **Paragraph Elements**
   - Utilized `<p>` tags to structure blocks of text, such as descriptions of my work experience and education.

### 4. **Void Elements**
   - Incorporated void elements like `<hr>` and `<img>`, which do not have closing tags.

### 5. **List Elements**
   - Created unordered lists (`<ul>`) to display work experience and skills.

### 6. **Nesting and Indentation**
   - Practiced proper nesting and indentation to ensure the HTML code is clean, readable, and easy to maintain.

### 7. **Anchor Elements**
   - Added a link using `<a>` tags to provide my contact details.

### 8. **File Paths**
   - Managed relative file paths for linking to my contact page and an image of me in a graduation gown.
